We're building our flagship product, [Check](https://meedan.com/en/check/), using a set of Rails backend
services and a React frontend (multiple frontends actually, most of which are coded using React).
We decided to use GraphQL as a data communication language, because it provides
a closer mapping to our internal data model, compared to a REST API. Here's a talk that I gave at [Rubyfuza
2018](http://www.rubyfuza.org/) in beautiful Cape Town, South Africa.
